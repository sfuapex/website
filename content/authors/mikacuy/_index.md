I am a PhD at Stanford University advised by [Leonidas Guibas](https://geometry.stanford.edu/member/guibas/). My research interests are in 3D vision, geometry processing, graphics and machine learning. Specifically, I am interested in diving into different representations of 3D objects and scenes for various downstream tasks in 3D content creation. I was previously a research intern at Adobe Research, Autodesk Research and Google Research. I am grateful to be a recipient of the 2023 Apple Scholars in AI/ML PhD Fellowship and 2022 Snap Research Fellowship, and to be selected as one of the EECS Rising Stars 2023. I'm originally from Manila, Philippines.
